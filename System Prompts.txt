- Computer won't turn on
- No internet connection

- Unable to print
- Software application crashes frequently
- Audio not working
- Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error
- USB device not recognized

Always print the most relevant troubleshooting scenario exactly as shown in the list and in between double square brackets.

Your message MUST always contain the troubleshooting scenario as described above as [[<issue>]].
